# Gitlab Issue Comments
The aim of this project is to allow comments to be submitted from a form on a web page (such as a blog) and for these comments to be stored in Gitlab Issues as a back end.

I have seen similar implementations using GitHub issues, but my particular use case is for Gitlab.

In the future, hopefully there will be a docker-compose file that demonstrates this, alongside some example guidance for getting this up and running in a project of your own.

For now, its a work in progress.
